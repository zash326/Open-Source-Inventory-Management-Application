##Challenge #2 Open Source Inventory Management Application (Summer Collab)


**Solve For:** Nonprofits that want to share physical products or other inventory resources.


**Example Solution Direction:** Create a management tool for requesting and tracking materials for educational organizations.


**Use-Case Overview:** SummerCollab works with community-based agencies serving low income youth.  We help these agencies improve their capacity to run high-quality academic programming. Our network includes 12 partner agencies who execute our custom designed project based curriculum, which contains an extensive supply list. We have a finite amount of the supplies available (approximately 47k in reusable supplies with an inventory list), and a certain amount of money allocated for each agency to supplement supplies.  SummerCollab would like a tool that can help agencies purchase and rent all needed supplies for each week of program.  This system should also track when SummerCollab materials are rented and returned by our partners. Overall this tool will help our partner camps manage supply needs, purchasing, and management which will in turn ensure all kids have more reliable access to well executed curriculum. 


**Assets:** Nonprofit SummerCollabâ€™s educational inventory list as an example data set.


**Possible Technical Needs:** database management; request and approval interface; calendar function; various levels of privacy
